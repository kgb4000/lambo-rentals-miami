            Do I need Insurance to rent a Lamborghini?
          </h3>
          <p>
            You must provide proof of an active insurance policy in the primary
            renter’s name. The policy must provide collision, comprehensive, and
            liability coverage that transfers to your rental. Even if you drive
            a 1996 Honda Accord your full coverage insurance will cover in all
            50 states. American Express offers “Premium Insurance” that can act
            as your primary insurance during your rental period.
